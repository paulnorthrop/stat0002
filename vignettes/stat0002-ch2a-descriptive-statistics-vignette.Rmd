The main purpose of this vignette is to provide R code to calculate the summary statistics that feature in Section 2.3 of the [STAT0002 notes](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=8579&section=3) (apart from correlation, which we defer until Chapter 9).  An important point to appreciate is that usually there is more than one way to estimate from data a particular theoretical property of the distribution from which the data came. For example, we will see that there are many different rules (*estimators*) that can be used to estimate a quantile of a distribution.

The R code used in this vignette are available: [descriptive-statistics-vignette.R](stat0002-ch2a-descriptive-statistics-vignette.R).
 The functions `five_number`, `skew` and `q_skew` can be viewed either by typing the name of the function at R command prompt `>` or at  [GitHub](https://github.com/paulnorthrop/stat0002/blob/master/R/descriptive_statistics.R)

## The Oxford Birth Times data 

These data are available in the data frame `ox_births`.  Use `?ox_births` to find out about these data.
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(stat0002)
```

We manipulate the data into a matrix that is of the same format as Table 2.1 in the notes.  The number of birth times varies between days so we pad the matrix with R's missing values code `NA` in order that each column of the matrix has the same number of rows.

```{r}
ox_mat <- matrix(NA, ncol = 7, nrow = 16)
for (i in 1:7) {
  day_i_times <- ox_births$time[which(ox_births$day == i)]
  ox_mat[1:length(day_i_times), i] <- sort(day_i_times)
  colnames(ox_mat) <- paste("day", 1:7, sep = "")
}  
ox_mat
```

1. **Can you see what the following parts of the code do?**

```{r}
i <- 4
ox_births$day == i
which(ox_births$day == i)
ox_births$time[which(ox_births$day == i)]
paste("day", 1:7, sep = "")
paste("day", 1:7, sep = " ")
```

We return to this matrix later.  Until then we calculate summary statistics of the dataset containing the birth times from all days of the week.  

```{r}
birth_times <- ox_births[, "time"]
sort(birth_times)
```

## Five number summary

The function `five_number` calculates the five number summary of data, using the particular method for estimating the lower quartile, median and upper quartile described in the STAT0002 notes.

```{r}
five_number(birth_times)
```

The `summary` function can also be used to calculate a five number summary.

```{r}
summary(birth_times)
```

2. **(If we ignore the fact that `summary` also calculates the sample mean) does `summary` produce the same values as `five_number`?**

No, the estimates of the lower quartile differ.  This is because the functions `summary` and `five_number` use different rules to estimate quantiles: `summary` calls `quantile` using `type = 7` whereas `five_number` uses `type = 6`.  If we call `five_number` with `type = 7` we get the same numbers as `summary`.

```{r}
five_number(birth_times, type = 7)
```

In fact the function `quantile` has 9 different options for `type`.  Use `?quantile` for more information.

## Sample mean 

```{r}
mean(birth_times)
```

## Sample standard deviation and variance

```{r}
sd(birth_times)
var(birth_times)
sd(birth_times) ^ 2
```

## Measures of skewness

```{r}
# Standardized sample skewness
skew(birth_times)
```
```{r}
# Sample quartile skewness
q_skew(birth_times)
```

Until 2017/18 the STAT0002 notes gave -0.063 as the sample quartile skewness.  This was because I used the default setting, `type = 7`, in the `quantile` function when calculating it ...

```{r}
q_skew(birth_times, type = 7)
```

## Summary statistics for each day

We can also calculate summary statistics for each of the seven days of the week, i.e. for each of the columns of `ox_mat`.  In the following the effect of the `colMeans` function is fairly obvious. `apply` is a useful function.  Use `?apply` to see what it does.

```{r}
five_number(ox_mat, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r}
summary(ox_mat)
```
```{r}
colMeans(ox_mat, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r}
apply(ox_mat, 2, sd, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r}
skew(ox_mat, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r}
q_skew(ox_mat, na.rm = TRUE)
```
