The purposes of this vignette are to direct you to R functions relating to the **continuous** probability distributions considered in Chapter 5 of the STAT0002 notes and to provide code to do some of the things that appear in the lecture slides.  We do this using the standard R functions (in the **stats** package) and using the **distributions3** package [@distributions3], which provides a neat way to work with random variables in R.  Please see the [Discrete Random Variables vignette](stat0002-ch5a-discrete-random-variables-vignette.html) for a brief introduction to these functions.

We illustrate these functions using the Australian birth times data, which are available in the data frame `aussie_births`.

```{r}
library(stat0002)
head(aussie_births)
```

## The uniform distribution

We will not say much about the uniform distribution here.  However, it is a very important distribution because the standard uniform distribution, U(0, 1), is use widely to simulate values from probability distributions. See the [Stochastic Simulation vignette](stat0002-ch1b-stochastic-simulation.html) for details.

First, we show two ways to produce a (pseudo-)random sample from a U(0, 1) distribution.  We use the same seed (use `?set.seed` to find out more) to show that these approaches are equivalent.  This is because the `distributions3` package actually uses the function `runif` in the background.

```{r}
# Using the runif() function in the stats package
set.seed(13112019)
n <- 10
u1 <- runif(n)
u1
# Using the distributions3 package to define a U(0, 1) object U
library(distributions3)
set.seed(13112019)
U <- Uniform(0, 1)
u2 <- random(U, 10)
u2
```

## The exponential distribution

The inversion method (see [Stochastic Simulation vignette](stat0002-ch1b-stochastic-simulation.html) for details) means that we can easily transform the simulated values produced by `runif` in a way that produces a (pseudo-)random sample from an exponential distribution.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=7}
lambda <- 2
u <- runif(1000)
e1 <- -log(u) / lambda
hist(e1, prob = TRUE, main = "")
```

We produce a histogram of sample waiting times in the Australian birth times data, with a superimposed exponential density.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=7}
# Calculate the sample waiting times, in minutes
w <- diff(c(0, aussie_births$time)) 
# Estimate lambda (rate of births per minute)
lambdahat <- 1 / mean(w)
# The estimate of the rate of births per hour
lambdahat * 60
# Histogram and superimposed exponential density
hist(w, prob = TRUE, breaks = 8, axes = FALSE, col = 8, ylim = c(0, 0.03),
     xlab = "time since last birth (minutes)", main = "")
axis(1, at = seq(0, 160, 20))
axis(2, at = seq(0, 0.03, 0.005))
curve(dexp(x, rate = lambdahat), add = TRUE, lwd = 2)
```

## The normal distribution

We use the birth weights in the Australian birth times data to illustrate how to perform calculations relating to the normal distribution.  

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=7}
# Convert weights from grams to pounds
wt <- aussie_births$weight / 453.5
# Produce a histogram of the birth weights
hist(wt, prob = TRUE, xlab = "weight (pounds)", col = 8, main = "")
```

We suppose that the weight $W$ (in pounds) of a randomly chosen baby has a $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ distribution, even though it seems clear from the histogram that this assumption may be inappropriate.

```{r}
# Estimate the mean, variance and (standard deviation) of W
muhat <- mean(wt)
sigma2hat <- var(wt)
sigmahat <- sd(wt)
```

Suppose that $W$ has a normal distribution, with mean equal to `muhat` and standard deviation equal to `sigmahat`.  In an example in the notes we calculated $P(W > 10)$, using a tables of c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution.  To perform this calculation in R we could do either of the following.

```{r}
pnorm(10, mean = muhat, sd = sigmahat, lower.tail = FALSE)
W <- Normal(mu = muhat, sigma = sigmahat)
1 - cdf(W, 10)
```

The answer that we get is slightly different from the one in the lecture slides, because we rounded a number (to 2.38) before we looked up the value that we needed in the table.  Below we confirm that R gives the same answer as the table (to 5 decimal places).

```{r}
pnorm(2.38)
1 - pnorm(2.38)
```

In the coffee example in the lecture slides we needed to calculate the 95\% quantile of a standard N(0, 1) normal random variable.  We could do this in one of the following ways.

```{r}
qnorm(0.95)
Z <- Normal(0, 1)
quantile(Z, 0.95)
```
