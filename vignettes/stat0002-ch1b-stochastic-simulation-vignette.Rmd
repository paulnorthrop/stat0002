Stochastic simulation uses computer-generated *pseudo-random numbers* to mimic a stochastic real event or dataset.  Pseudo-random numbers are not random (they are produced by an algorithm) but the algorithm is constructed in order to imitate randomness closely enough.  A typical use of stochastic simulation is to generate numbers that behave approximately like a random sample from an particular probability distribution.  

In this vignette we concentrate on using R to perform stochastic simulation.  If you want to know more then good sources of information are @Morgan and @Akyildiz.

The function `rbinomial` can be viewed by typing `rbinomial` at R command prompt `>`.

## Pseudo-random numbers in (0,1)

The basic building block of stochastic simulation methods is the ability to simulate numbers (pseudo-) randomly from the interval (0,1).  As we will see in Chapter 5 of the STAT0002 notes this is equivalent to generating numbers that behave approximately like a random sample from a standard uniform U(0,1) distribution.
The function in R that does this is `runif`.

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Set a random number `seed'.  
set.seed(1004)
```

```{r}
library(stat0002)
runif(10)
```

## Simulation from a binomial distribution

In the [Challenger Space Shuttle disaster](stat0002-ch1a-shuttle-vignette.html) vignette we needed to simulate numbers from a binomial distribution with parameters $6$ and $p$, for a given value of $p$.  As we will see in Chapter 5 of the STAT0002 notes this distribution arises as the number of 'successes' (perversely, in the space shuttle example thermal distress of an O-ring is a 'success') in a fixed number (here, this is 6) of independent trials, where each trial results either in a 'success' or a 'failure'.

Suppose that $p=0.2$, which is the approximate estimated probability (under a linear logistic model) that an O-ring suffers thermal distress when the space shuttle is launched at 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

The function in R that simulates from a binomial distribution is `rbinom`.

```{r}
rbinom(n = 1, size = 6, prob = 0.2)
```

1. **Can you see the convention in the way that R's simulation functions are named?**

Underlying `rbinom` is an algorithm that works quickly even in cases where the number of trials (`size`) is large.  With a small number of trials, like 6, we could work more directly, using numbers produced by `runif` to assign the result of each trial to 'success' or 'failure'.  This is like tossing a coin that is biased so that 'heads' is obtained with probability 0.2.  The function `rbinomial` below simulates *one* value from a binomial distribution with parameters `size` and `prob`.  Use `?rbinomial` to view the help file. This function is less general and less efficient than `rbinom`.  However, it is useful to illustrate a simple way to simulate from a binomial distribution and as an example of how we can write our own R functions to perform calculations.  

    rbinomial <- function(size, prob) {
      # Simulate size values (pseudo-)randomly between 0 and 1.
      u <- runif(size)
      # Find out whether (TRUE) or not (FALSE) each value of u is less than prob.
      distress <- u < prob
      # Count the number of TRUEs, i.e. the number of successes.
      n_successes <- sum(distress)
      # Return the number of successes.
      return(n_successes)
    }

We simulate one value from a binomial(6, 0.2) distribution.  [We use `set.seed` to initialize the pseudo-random number sequence in a particular place.  This will enable us to repeat these calculations below using exactly the same random numbers.]

```{r}
set.seed(1826)
rbinomial(size = 6, prob = 0.2)
```

2. **Can you work out what is happening in each line of the code inside `rbinomial`? The following should help.**

```{r}
set.seed(1826)
size <- 6
prob <- 0.2
u <- runif(size)
u
distress <- u < prob
distress
n_successes <- sum(distress)
n_successes
```

3. **The effect of `sum(distress)` is quite subtle.  Can you see what is happening?  Check your answer using `?sum`.**

A related point is that if we turn the logical vector `distress` (which contains `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s) into a numeric vector, then we get ...

```{r}
as.numeric(distress)
```

## Simulation from a exponential distribution

The exponential distribution is an example of a probability distribution of a continuous random variable.

4. **Can you guess the name of the R function for simulating from an exponential distribution?**

We simulate a sample of size 1000 from an exponential distribution with (rate) parameter equal to 2.
```{r, fig.show='hold'}
lambda <- 2
exp_sim <- rexp(n = 1000, rate = lambda)
```

We produce a histogram of these simulated values and superimpose the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the exponential distribution from which these values have been simulated.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
# A histogram (see Section 2.5 of the STAT0002 notes)
hist(exp_sim, probability = TRUE, ylim = c(0, lambda), main = "")
x <- seq(0, max(exp_sim), len = 500)
lines(x, dexp(x, rate = lambda))
```

5. **Can you guess what the function `dexp` does?  Use `?dexp` to find out.**

The following R code could also be used to simulate from an exponential distribution.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
u <- runif(1000)
exp_inv <- -log(u)/lambda
hist(exp_inv, probability = TRUE, ylim = c(0, lambda), main = "", breaks = 14, col = "grey")
lines(x, dexp(x, rate = lambda))
```

## The inversion method

The code immediately above is an example of the *inversion method* of simulation.  The following code implements this for the normal distribution.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
u <- runif(1000)
mu <- 0
sigma <- 1
norm_sim <- qnorm(u, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
hist(norm_sim, probability = TRUE, main = "", col = "grey")
x <- seq(min(norm_sim), max(norm_sim), len = 500)
lines(x, dnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma))
```

6. **Use `?qnorm` to find out what `qnorm` does.**

Note that the help page calls this the *quantile function*.  An alternative name is the *inverse cumulative distribution function* or *inverse c.d.f*.

## More general methods of simulation

Often the most efficient method of simulating values from a probability distribution is one that has been devised for that particular distribution.  However, it is useful to have more general methods that can, in principle, be used to simulate from any distribution, although, in practice, there are constraints on the type of distribution to which a method can be applied.  Many of these methods work by proposing values and then accepting or rejecting them using a rule (hence they are often called *acceptance-rejection* or *rejection* methods).  See @Morgan and @Akyildiz for details.  One such method is the *generalized ratio-of-uniforms* method (@WGS1991 and references therein), which can be used for univariate distributions (involving one random variable) and for multivariate distributions (involving two or more random variables), provided that the p.d.f. of the distributions satisfies some conditions.  

The *rust* R package [@rust] implements this algorithm.  The code below can be used to simulate from a standard normal distribution using the function `ru`.  

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, message = FALSE}
library(rust)
?ru
# Simulate from a standard normal N(0,1) distribution
ru_sim <- ru(logf = function(x) -x ^ 2 / 2, d = 1, n = 1000, init = 0.1)
# The function ru returns an object of class "ru"
class(ru_sim)
# The default plot method for objects of class "ru" produces a plot to compare the 
# simulated values and the p.d.f. of the distribution from which they are simulated
plot(ru_sim, xlab = "x")
```

Note that 

* the main input to this function is the (natural) log of the p.d.f of a standard normal distribution, i.e. the log of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac12 x^2}$;  
* we don't need to include the normalizing constant $1/\sqrt{2\pi}$, that is, the constant that is included to ensure that the p.d.f. integrates to 1 over the support $-\infty < x < \infty$ of this distribution. 

The second point, a typical feature of *rejection* methods, can be important because there are cases where we can't easily calculate the normalizing constant.

We the use of `ru` to simulate from a multivariate distribution using the bivariate normal distribution. This distribution will be studied in the second-year statistics module STAT0005. See the Wikipedia page for the 
[multivariate normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) for the form of the p.d.f. of this distribution.  The function `log_dmvnorm` below calculates the log of the p.d.f. of the multivariate normal distribution with mean vector `mean` and variance-covariance matrix `sigma`, again ignoring the normalizing constant.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
# two-dimensional normal with positive association ----------------
rho <- 0.9
covmat <- matrix(c(1, rho, rho, 1), 2, 2)
log_dmvnorm <- function(x, mean = rep(0, d), sigma = diag(d)) {
  x <- matrix(x, ncol = length(x))
  d <- ncol(x)
  return(- 0.5 * (x - mean) %*% solve(sigma) %*% t(x - mean))
}
ru_sim2 <- ru(logf = log_dmvnorm, sigma = covmat, d = 2, n = 1000, init = c(0, 0))
```

In the bivariate case the `plot` method for objects of class "ru" produces a scatter plot of the simulated values of the random variables $(X_1, X_2)$ with the contours of the value of the p.d.f. superimposed.  Each contour is labelled by a number indicating the percentage of the simulated values that should lie within that contour.

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
plot(ru_sim2, xlab = expression(X[1]), ylab = expression(X[2]))
```

The generalized ratio-of-uniforms method works well enough for this example but it is not the most efficient way to simulate from a multivariate normal distribution.  A better function is the `mvrnorm` in the MASS package [@MASS].  Use `library(MASS)` and `?mvrnorm` to find out about it.
