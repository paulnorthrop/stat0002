\title{World Bank Development Indicators Movie}
\value{
Nothing is returned, only the animation is produced.
}
\description{
Explores graphically relationships between four annual World Development
Indicators provided in the World Bank's database for the countries of the
world, 1960-2014.  Animation is used to visualise how these variables and
their inter-relationships vary over time.
}
\details{
The example code in \strong{Examples} below creates a scatter
plot of data on the variables
given by the first two arguments of the function, i.e.
\code{log(gdp_per_capita)} and \code{log(co2_per_capita)}.
Each pair of values in represented by a circle.  The area of the
circle is proportional to the argument \code{size}, i.e.
\code{population_size} and the argument \code{col} indicates the
approximate value of the fourth variable, i.e. \code{life_expectancy}.

The scatter plot can be animated over years and points for an individual
country can be highlighted in red by clicking the name of the country.

See \code{\link[rpanel]{rp.bubbleplot}} for more information.

This type of plot was used to great effect by
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling}{Hans Rosling}.
To see Hans explain in simple terms the scientific and political issues
surrounding these data see
