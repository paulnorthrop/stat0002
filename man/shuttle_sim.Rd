\title{Simulate fake space shuttle data}
\usage{
shuttle_sim(n_sim = 1, temperature = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_sim}{A integer scalar. The number of fake datasets to simulate.}

\item{temperature}{A numeric vector of launch temperatures.

  If \code{temperature} is not supplied then the 23 launch temperatures
  from the real dataset are used.

  If \code{temperature} is supplied then it must be a vector of length one
  (i.e. a scalar). In this event \code{n_sim} gives the number of
  simulated numbers of damaged O-rings at launch temperature
  \code{temperature}.  If \code{temperature} has length greater than one
  then only the first element of \code{temperature} is used and a warning
  is given.}
}
\value{
The output depends on whether or not \code{temperature} is supplied by
the user.

If \code{temperature} \emph{is} supplied then \code{shuttle_sim}
returns a dataframe with 2 + \code{n_sim} columns.
Column 1 contains the launch temperatures, column 2 contains the numbers
of distressed O-rings in the real data and columns 3 to
2 + \code{n_sim} the \code{n_sim} simulated datasets.

If \code{temperature} \emph{is not} supplied then \code{shuttle_sim}
returns a vector of length \code{n_sim}.

\description{
Simulates fake O-ring thermal distress data for Challenger Space Shuttle
launches at different launch temperatures.  The simulated data are based
on a linear logistic regression model fitted to the real data from the 23
(pre-disaster) launches.
}
\details{
The data are simulated from a linear logistic regression model
  fitted to the real (pre-disaster) O-ring distress and launch
  temperature data.  For a given launch temperature \eqn{t} this model
  provides an estimate, \eqn{\hat{p}(t)} say, of the probability that an
  O-ring suffers thermal distress.  Then the number of the 6 O-rings
  that suffers from thermal distress is simulated from a
  binomial(6, \eqn{\hat{p}(t)}) distribution, under an assumption that
  the fates of the O-rings are independent.  This is repeated for each of
  the launch temperatures in \code{temperatures}.

  vignette.
