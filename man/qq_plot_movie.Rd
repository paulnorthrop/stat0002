\usage{
qq_plot_movie(data = NULL, mu = NULL, sigma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector.  Data on which to base the QQ plot.}

\item{mu, sigma}{Numeric scalars.  The mean and standard deviation of
the normal distribution to which the data \code{data} are to be compared.
If \code{mu} and/or \code{sigma} are not supplied then they are estimated
from the data.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned, only the animation is produced.

\description{
A movie to illustrate the constructions of a normal Quantile-Quantile
(QQ) plot.
}
\details{
This movie enables the user to scroll forwards and backwards
  through plots that describe the way in which a (normal) QQ plot is
  produced.  This movie is designed for simple illustrative examples
  with small numbers of observations, that is, for small
  \code{length(data)}.  The example below has only 9 observations.
  In cases where there are many more observations than this the plots
  will be a bit of a mess!

\examples{
# Create the same dataset used in the lecture notes/slides
set.seed(382)
x <- sort(round(rnorm(9, mean = 7.72, sd = 3.57), 2))
qq_plot_movie(data = x, mu = 7.72, sigma = 3.57)
