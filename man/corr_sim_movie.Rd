  rho = 0,
  panel_plot = TRUE,
  hscale = NA,
  vscale = hscale,
  delta_n = 1,

\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer scalar.  The initial value of the sample size.
Must not be less than 2.}

\item{rho}{A numeric scalar.  The initial value of the true correlation
\eqn{\rho}.  Must be in [-1, 1].}

\item{panel_plot}{A logical parameter that determines whether the plot
is placed inside the panel (\code{TRUE}) or in the standard graphics
window (\code{FALSE}).  If the plot is to be placed inside the panel
then the tkrplot library is required.}

\item{hscale}{Numeric scalars.  Scaling parameters for the size
of the plot when \code{panel_plot = TRUE}. The default values are 1.4 on
Unix platforms and 2 on Windows platforms.}

\item{vscale}{Numeric scalars.  Scaling parameters for the size
of the plot when \code{panel_plot = TRUE}. The default values are 1.4 on
Unix platforms and 2 on Windows platforms.}

\item{delta_n}{An integer scalar.  The amount by which the value of the
sample size is increased/decreased after one click of the +/- button.}

\item{delta_rho}{A numeric scalar.  The amount by which the value of
rho is increased/decreased after one click of the +/- button.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the rpanel functions
\code{\link[rpanel]{rp.button}} and
\code{\link[rpanel]{rp.doublebutton}}, not including \code{panel},
\code{variable}, \code{title}, \code{step}, \code{action}, \code{initval},

\description{
A movie to illustrate how the sampling distribution of the product moment
sample correlation coefficient \eqn{r} depends on the sample size \eqn{n}
and on the true correlation \eqn{\rho}.
}
\details{
Random samples of size \eqn{n} are simulated from a bivariate
  normal distribution
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution}{bivariate normal distribution}
  in which each of the variables has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 and
  the correlation \eqn{\rho} between the variables is chosen by the user.

  The movie contains two plots.  On the top is a scatter plot of the
  simulated sample, illustrating the strength of the association between
  the simulated values of the variables.
  A new sample is produced by clicking "simulate another sample.
  For each simulated sample the sample (product moment) correlation
  coefficient \eqn{r} is calculated and displayed in the title of the top
  plot.

  The values of the sample correlation coefficients are stored and are
  plotted in a histogram in the bottom plot.  A rug displays the individual
  values, with the most recent value coloured red. As we accumulate a large
  number of values in this histogram the shape of the sampling
  distribution of \eqn{r} emerges.  The exact p.d.f. of \eqn{r} is
  superimposed on this histogram, as is the value of \eqn{\rho}.

  The bottom plot can be changed in two ways:
  (i) a radio button can be pressed to replace the histogram and pdf with
  a plot of the empirical c.d.f. and exact cdf;
  (ii) the variable can be changed from \eqn{\rho} to Fisher's
  z-transformation \eqn{F(\rho) = arctanh(\rho) = [ln(1+\rho) - ln(1-\rho)]/2}.
  For sufficiently large values of \eqn{n}, \eqn{F(\rho)} has approximately
  a normal distribution with mean \eqn{\rho} and variance
  \eqn{1 / (n - 3)}.

  The values of the sample size \eqn{n} or true correlation coefficient
  \eqn{\rho} can be changed using the respective +/- buttons.
  If one of these is changed then the bottom plot is
  reset using the sample correlation coefficient of the first sample
  simulated using the new combination of \eqn{n} and \eqn{\rho}.
