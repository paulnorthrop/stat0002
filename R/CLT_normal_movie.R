#' Central Limit Theorem movie: normal data
#'
#' A movie to illustrate the ideas of a sampling distribution of a random
#' variable and the central limit theorem (CLT).  In this case (based on
#' random samples from a normal distribution) the CLT provides an exact
#' result.
#'
#' @param n An integer scalar.  The size of the samples drawn from a
#'   normal distribution.
#' @param mu,sigma Numeric scalars.  The respective mean and standard
#'   deviation of the normal distribution from which data are to be
#'   simulated using \code{\link{rnorm}}.
#' @param xlab A character scalar.  A name to use to label the horizontal
#'   axis of the plots.
#' @param pos A numeric integer.  Used in calls to \code{\link{assign}}
#'   to make information available across successive frames of a movie.
#'   By default, uses the current environment.
#' @param envir An alternative way (to \code{pos}) of specifying the
#'   environment. See \code{\link{environment}}.
#' @details Loosely speaking, a consequence of the
#'   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem}{Central Limit Theorem (CLT)}
#'   is that, in many situations, the mean of a \strong{large number} of
#'   independent random variables has \strong{approximately} a normal distribution,
#'   even if these original variables are not normally distributed.
#'
#'   This movie illustrates this in the very special case where the original
#'   variables \emph{are} normally distributed.  Samples of size \code{n}
#'   are repeatedly simulated from a normal distribution.  These samples are
#'   summarized using a histogram that appears at the top of the movie screen.
#'   For each sample the mean of these \code{n} values is calculated, stored
#'   and added to another histogram plotted below the first histogram.
#'   The respective probability density functions (p.d.f.s) of the original
#'   variables and the means are superimposed on these histograms.
#'   The latter is know to be exactly a normal p.d.f. in this special case.
#'
#'   The user may choose the sample size \code{n}, that is, the number of
#'   values over which a mean is calculated, the mean \code{mu} and/or
#'   standard deviation \code{sigma} of the normal distribution from which
#'   values are simulated and the label \code{xlab} for the horizontal axis.
#'
#'   Once it starts, two aspects of this movie are controlled by the user.
#'   Firstly, there are buttons to increase (+) or decrease (-) the sample
#'   size, that is, the number of values over which a mean is calculated.
#'   Then there is a button labelled "simulate another sample of size n".
#'   Each time this button is clicked a new sample is simulated and its sample
#'   mean added to the bottom histogram.
#'
#'   Another movie (\code{\link{clt_exponential_movie}}) illustrates the CLT
#'   in the case where the original variables are exponentially distributed.
#' @return Nothing is returned, only the animation is produced.
#' @seealso \code{\link{stat0002movies}}: general information about the movies.
#' @seealso \code{\link{clt_exponential_movie}}: a similar movie using data
#'   simulated from an exponential distribution.
