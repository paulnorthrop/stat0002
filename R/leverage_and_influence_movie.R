# ================================= lev_inf_movie =============================

#' Leverage and influence movie
#'
#' A movie to examine the influence of a single outlying observation on a
#' least squares regression line.
#' @param association A character scalar.  Determines the type of association
#'   between (not-outlying) observations: "positive" for positive linear
#'   association; "negative" negative linear association; "none" for no
#'   association.
#' @param n An integer scalar.  The size of the sample of (non-outlying)
#'   observations.
#' @details \code{n} pairs of observations are simulated with the property
#'   that the mean of response variable \eqn{y} is a linear function of the
#'   values of the explanatory variable \eqn{x}.  These pairs of observations
#'   are plotted using filled black circles.  An extra observation is plotted
#'   using a filled red circle.  Initially this observation is placed in the
#'   middle of the plot.
#'
#'   Superimposed on the plot are two least squares regression lines:
#'   one based on all the data (`with outlier') and one in which the
#'   `red' observation has been removed (`without outlier'.
#'   Initially these lines coincide.
#'
#'   The location of the `red' observation can be changed using the
#'   +/- buttons so that the effect of the position of this observation
#'   on the `with outlier' line can be seen.
#'
#'   We see that if the red observation is outlying, that is, it is far
#'   from the least squares line fitted to the other observations, then
#'   its \strong{influence} on the least squares regression line depends on
#'   its x-coordinate.  If its x-coordinate is much larger or smaller than
#'   the x-coordinate of the other observations (high \strong{leverage}) then
#'   the influence is higher than if it has a similar x-coordinate to the
#'   other observations (low \strong{leverage}).  An observation with high
#'   leverage does not necessarily have high influence: if its y-coordinate
#'   falls very close to the regression line fitted to the other observations
#'   then its influence will be low.
