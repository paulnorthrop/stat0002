#' Central Limit Theorem movie: exponential data
#'
#' A movie to illustrate the idea of a sampling distribution and the central
#' limit theorem (CLT) in a situation where data are simulated randomly
#' from an exponential distribution.
#'
#' @param n An integer scalar.  The size of the samples drawn from a
#'   normal distribution.
#' @param lambda A numeric scalar.  The rate parameter of the exponential
#'   distribution from which data are to be simulated using \code{\link{rexp}}.
#' @param xlab A character scalar.  A name to use to label the horizontal
#'   axis of the plots.
#' @param pos A numeric integer.  Used in calls to \code{\link{assign}}
#'   to make information available across successive frames of a movie.
#'   By default, uses the current environment.
#' @param envir An alternative way (to \code{pos}) of specifying the
#'   environment. See \code{\link{environment}}.
#' @details Loosely speaking, a consequence of the
#'   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem}{Central Limit Theorem (CLT)}
#'   is that, in many situations, the mean of a \strong{large number} of
#'   independent random variables has \strong{approximately} a normal distribution,
#'   even if these original variables are not normally distributed.
#'
#'   This movie illustrates this in the case where the original variables
#'   are exponentially distributed.  Samples of size \code{n} are repeatedly
#'   simulated from an exponential distribution.  These samples are
#'   summarized using a histogram that appears at the top of the movie screen.
#'   For each sample the mean of these \code{n} values is calculated, stored
#'   and added to another histogram plotted below the first histogram.
#'   The (exponential) probability density function (p.d.f.) of the original
#'   variables is superimposed on the top histogram.  On the bottom histogram
#'   is superimposed the approximate (large \code{n}) p.d.f. given by the
#'   CLT.
#'
#'   The user may choose the sample size \code{n}, that is, the number of
#'   values over which a mean is calculated, the rate parameter \code{lambda}
#'   of the exponential normal distribution from which values are simulated
#'   and the label \code{xlab} for the horizontal axis.
#'
#'   Once it starts, two aspects of this movie are controlled by the user.
#'   Firstly, there are buttons to increase (+) or decrease (-) the sample
#'   size, that is, the number of values over which a mean is calculated.
#'   Then there is a button labelled "simulate another sample of size n".
#'   Each time this button is clicked a new sample is simulated and its sample
#'   mean added to the bottom histogram.
#'
#'   Another movie (\code{\link{clt_normal_movie}}) considers the special case
#'   where the original variables are normally distributed.
#' @return Nothing is returned, only the animation is produced.
#' @seealso \code{\link{stat0002movies}}: general information about the movies.
#' @seealso \code{\link{clt_normal_movie}}: a similar movie using data
#'   simulated from a normal distribution.
#' @examples
#' # Produce movie using values based on the Aussie births data
#' clt_exponential_movie(44, 1.84, "time since last birth (hours)")
#'
#' # ... and with some smaller sample sizes
#' clt_exponential_movie(10, 1.84, "time since last birth (hours)")
