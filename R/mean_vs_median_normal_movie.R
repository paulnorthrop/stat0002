# ========================= mean_vs_median_normal_movie =======================

#' Sample mean vs sample median: normally distributed data
#'
#' A movie to compare the sampling distributions of the sample mean
#' and sample median based on a random sample of size \eqn{n} from a
#' standard normal distribution.
#'
#' @param n An integer scalar.  The size of the samples drawn from a
#'   standard normal distribution.
#' @param delta_n A numeric scalar.  The amount by which the value of the
#'   sample size is increased/decreased after one click of the +/- button.
#' @param pos A numeric integer.  Used in calls to \code{\link{assign}}
#'   to make information available across successive frames of a movie.
#'   By default, uses the current environment.
#' @param envir An alternative way (to \code{pos}) of specifying the
#'   environment. See \code{\link{environment}}.
#' @details The movie is based on simulating repeatedly samples of size
#'   \code{n} from a standard normal N(0,1) distribution.  It contains
#'   three plots.  The top plot contains a histogram of the most recently
#'   simulated dataset, with the N(0,1) probability density function (p.d.f.)
#'   superimposed.
#'
#'   Each time a sample is simulated the sample mean and sample median are
#'   calculated.  These values are indicated on the top plot as a filled
#'   circle: a red circle for the sample mean and a blue circle for the
#'   sample median; and are added to the values plotted in the middle and
#'   bottom plots.
#'
#'   The plot in the middle contains a histogram of
#'   the sample means of \emph{all} the simulated samples.  The p.d.f.s of
#'   the sampling distributions of the sample mean (thick red line)
#'   and the sample medians (thin blue line) are superimposed.
#'
#'   The plot on the bottom contains a histogram of
#'   the sample medians of \emph{all} the simulated samples.  The p.d.f.s of
#'   the sampling distributions of the sample mean (thin red line)
#'   and the sample medians (thick blue line) are superimposed.
#'
#'   An extra sample is produced by clicking the + button next to
#'   "number of samples of size n". [Ignore the - button.]
#'   The value of the sample size can be changed using the +/-
#'   buttons in the panel.
#' @return Nothing is returned, only the animation is produced.
#' @seealso \code{\link{stat0002movies}}: general information about the movies.
#' @seealso  \code{\link{mean_vs_median_t_movie}}: compares the
#'   sampling distributions of the sample mean and sample median based
#'   on a random sample of size \eqn{n} from a Student's t distribution.
